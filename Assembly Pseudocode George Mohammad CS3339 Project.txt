Read byte by byte while checking for \n and the search criteria characters and when you encounter \n, reset any flag variables/registers. Increment the search criteria character registers as needed.

X86 can read a string from a file, so maybe having an array with all the letters needed would work better than converting the ascii values to characters.

Check branch condition
Branch
Read Byte
Check for \. If it's present, set a flag.
increment the byte you're considering. ie. Increment the file pointer.
Check for n. If it's present, set a flag.
Check for search criteria characters.
If the characters exist in the correct order, write the acronym to a file.
